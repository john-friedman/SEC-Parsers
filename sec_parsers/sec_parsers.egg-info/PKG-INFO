# SEC Parsers
Parses non-standardized SEC 10-K & 10-Q filings into well structured detailed xml. Use cases include LLMs, NLP, and textual analysis. This is a WIP. Not every file will parse correctly.

### Installation
```pip install sec-parsers```

### Quickstart
```
from sec_parsers import Parser, download_sec_filing

html = download_sec_filing('https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231.htm')
filing = Parser(html)
filing.parse() # parses filing
filing.visualize() # opens filing in webbrowser with highlighted section headers
filing.find_nodes_by_title(title) # finds node by title, e.g. 'item 1a'
filing.find_nodes_by_text(text) # finds nodes which contains your text
filing.get_tree(node) # if no argument specified returns xml tree, if node specified, returns that nodes tree
filing.get_title_tree() # returns xml tree using titles instead of tags. More descriptive than get_tree.
filing.save_xml(file_name)
filing.save_csv(file_name)
```

For more information look at the [quickstart](Examples/quickstart.ipynb), or view a parsed Tesla 10-K [here](Examples/tesla_10k.xml). SEC Parsers also supports exporting to csv, see [here](Examples/tesla_10k.csv).

### Problem:
SEC filings are human readable, but messy html makes it hard for machines to detect and read information by section. This is especially important for NLP / RAG using LLMs.

### How SEC Parsers works:
1. Detects headers in filings using:
* element tags, e.g. `<b>Item 1</b>`
* element css, e.g. `<p style="font-weight: bold;">Item 1.</p>`
* text style, e.g. emphasis style "Purchase of Significant Equipment"
* relative location of above elements to each other
2. Calculates hierarchy of headers, and converts to a tree structure

### Roadmap:
1. Parser that converts >95% of filings into nicely formatted xml trees. 
2. Apply data science on xml to cluster headers, e.g. seasonality, seasonal variation etc, to make xml easier to work with.

### Possible future features
* better hierarchy calculation
* more filings supported
* better rag integration
* converting html tables to nice xml tables
* metadata, e.g. cik / data from xbrl in html
* hosting cleaned xml files online
* better color scheme (color scheme for headers, ignored_elements - e.g. page numbers, text)
* better descriptions of functions
* add xbrl information

### Feature request:
* save_dta - save xml to dta. similar to csv function

### Statistics
* 100% parsed html rate
* 80% conversion to xml rate
* between 0.2s-8s to parse a filing.

### Issues
1. It looks like the filings I downloaded using edgartools may be different than sec filings downloaded directly from sec archives. investigating...

### Other people's SEC stuff
* [edgartools](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools) - good interface for interacting with SEC's EDGAR system
* [sec-parser](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec-parser) - oops, we have similar names. They were first, my bad. They parse 10-Qs well.
* [sec-api](https://sec-api.io/). Paid API to search / download SEC filings. Basically, SEC's EDGAR but setup in a much nicer format. I haven't used it since it costs money.
* [Bill McDonald's 10-X Archive](https://sraf.nd.edu/data/stage-one-10-x-parse-data/)
* [Eclect](https://eclect.us/) - "Save time reading SEC filings with the help of machine learning.". Paid.
* [Textblocks.app](https://www.textblocks.app/) - Paid API to extract and analyze structured data from SEC filings. The approach seems to be similar to mine.
* [Yu Zhu](https://yuzhu.run/how-to-parse-10x/) - article with an approach to parse 10K filings using regex
* [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/sec-analytics-suite/) - heard they have SEC stuff, looking into it
* [Gist](https://gist.github.com/anshoomehra/ead8925ea291e233a5aa2dcaa2dc61b2) - using regex and beautifulsoup to parse 10Ks
* Computer Vision using OpenCV
* LLMs (I believe unstructured.io does something like this)
* Transformers
